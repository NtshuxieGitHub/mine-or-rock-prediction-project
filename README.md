# Logistic Regression Model Development Project

This project demonstrates how to build a simple logistic regression model in Python using the scikit-learn library. The entire workflow—from data import and exploration to training, evaluation, and predictions—is carried out in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Structure

- data/sonardata.csv
- notebooks/mine_or_rock_analysis.ipynb - Jupyter notebook containing the full project code
- README.md - Project documentation
- requirements.txt - contains all the dependencies that were used for this project
- src [redacted]

## Requirements

To run this project, install the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run

1. Place your datasets (sonardata.csv) inside the `data/` folder.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. cd into the notebooks folder
4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

mine_or_rock_analysis.ipynb

4. Execute the notebook cells step-by-step to run the entire workflow.

## Notes

- Small datasets may result in unstable or inconsistent performance  
- Accuracy on training data does not always translate to accuracy on unseen data  
- Predictions may fail if input data format or features differ from the training set  
- Improve results with more data, regularization, feature selection, and cross-validation
